# Calculator
This is a lightweight calculator package for performing simple calculation operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, and reset. For each operation, it takes only one input number and combines it with the current value in the calculator memory. The memory value can be reset at any time.

## Features

- Addition : Adds input value to memory value
- Subtraction : Subtracts input value from memory value
- Multiplication : Multiplies input value by memory value
- Division : Divides input value by memory value
- Root : Returns the input value root of the memory value
- Reset : Resets memory value to zero
